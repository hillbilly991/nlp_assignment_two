    "## Crawl Reviews\n",
    "The first part of this system is Crawl Reviews and is adapted from Hu & Liu (n.d). This initial step extracts the reviews from the .txt files in the `/Data` folder and then builds the foundations of the Review Database, which in this instance is the `df_product_reviews` dataframe in the following step. Each line is extracted into a Pandas dataframe (Python, n.d). It's done in this way to keep the original raw product lines in a separate dataframe. Pandas dataframes are particularly useful since they make storing and extracting data a lot easier than, for example, spreadsheets (Python, n.d). Also, since this system is written in Python, many of the other libraries we will be using expect a Pandas dataframe such as the apriori algorithm used in the `Frequent Features Identification` step (Medium, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in the .txt files are either a review or the title of a review - both of which contain product feature sentiments. It is important to note that there have been changes made by the author to some of the original .txt files such as removing squares of <strong>*</strong> which denoted a header in some of the product files, as well as removing some README files. Both of these were removed since they did not have product reviews in them which meant they had no bearing on classifying product features in future steps."

Furthermore, we know from the README files that <strong>feature[+/-]</strong> denotes groundtruth labels of the review sentences provided by the authors Hu & Liu (n,d). We want to keep these along with the review sentences, denoted by <strong>##</strong> since these will be used to analyse how well our classification models performed in our sentiment analysis in the future.

    "### Preprocess\n",
    "Preprocessing data is crucial for removing noisy information, enriching information and cleaning data before running it through other algorithms (such as the classification algorithms at the end of this report)(Singh et al, 2021). The preprocessing steps here are influenced by the preprocessing steps in Hu & Liu (n.d). These preprocessing steps are required before the feature identification steps in the downstream parts of the pipeline because they ensure that the data is in a consistent format, reduce dimensionality, and remove irrelevant or redundant features (Singh et al, 2021). This should ultimately improve the accuracy and efficiency of the subsequent feature identification and classification processes although there was no comparative assesment done on this particular section so further work could validate the effectiveness of these preprocessing steps on the overall performance of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps are  deliberately performed in a particular order, the justifications of which are as follows:\n",
    "1. Word tokenisation: Word tokenisation breaks a sentence into individual tokens so it is easier to perform future preprocessing steps like remove stopwords, remove punctuation and lemmatization (Zakaria, 2024).\n",
    "2. Remove stopwords and punctuation: stopwords and punctuation are often useless for determining product features and their sentiment, so they are removed (Hu & Liu, n.d). This is deliberately done prior to PoS tagging to reduce the noise in the text, making it easier for the PoS tagger to identify relevant words accurately. This step is also deliberately done before lemmatization because lemmatization is computationally expensive so performing this step first reduces the computational overheard required for lemmatization (Jain, 2024). The algorithm used `str.maketrans` which is to remove the string if it is just quotation marks. An empty string does not hold meaniningful information to help us classify sentences.\n",
    "3. Lowercase words: words are lowercased to maintain consistency for each word. Words are lowercased after removing stopwords since some words that are not stopwords can become those when lowercased (such as US the country becoming us, which is a stopword). It is also done before PoS tagging and lemmatization to ensure consistency and to avoid discrepancies caused by case differences (Ved, 2020).\n",
    "4. Parts of Speech (PoS) Tagging: this labels all PoS with the correct annotations. This is important for adjectives, since these are potential sentiments, and nouns, since these are potential product features (Hu & Liu, n.d). These tags are then used to analyse adjectives and nouns in the relevant stages later in the pipelines such as extracting Frequent Features and Infrequent Features with their Opinion Words (Saumyab271, 2022). It is done before lemmatization since it is important that the correct lemma is used, and without the PoS tag, the PoS tagging library can make mistakes and provide the wrong lemma for the token.\n",
    "5. Lemmatization: this finds the base form, or lemma, of each word and therefore makes it much easier to analyse the usage of different words more easily in later stages (Saumyab271, 2022). For example, if someone in their review stated that “the battery is great” and another stated that “the batteries are excellent”, then lemmatization would lemmatize batteries to battery This would mean that the opinion miner system could then find a common feature, battery, more easily.\n"

    "This step retrieves the frequent features for the opinion miner. Here, association mining is used, and it is done so using the Apriori algorithm (Hu & Liu, n.d). Association mining is a technique used in data mining to find interesting and useful associations between different itemsets (D, 2018). In this opinion miner system, we want to find frequent features for the different products, which means we want to find the common nouns and noun groups that are seen together for each product (Hu & Liu, n.d). Association mining is therefore a useful technique to deploy because we can find which common nouns and noun groups are often seen and therefore, potentially, what some of the frequent features are. Without the previous step tagging tokens with their PoS tags, this would not be possible since we would not know whether a token was a noun or noun group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association rule mining uses a minimum support value to state that if a token is associated with another word that is equal to or above the minimum threshold then it is identified as a common itemset and kept (Hu & Liu, n.d). It is deliberately set to a very low value of 0.01 since this will return as many common itemsets as possible that can then be pruned in the Redundancy Pruning and Compactness Pruning steps that follow (Hu & Liu, n.d).\n",
    "\n",
    "As adapted from Hu & Liu(n.d), Association rule mining works by:\n",
    "1. defining a set of items, called <strong>I</strong> which are the noun and noun groups that we want to find associate with one another.\n",
    "2. defining another set of items, called <strong>D</strong>, which is just a subset of items from <strong>I</strong>. <strong>D</strong> and <strong>I</strong> are comapred to identify patterns and relationships between these items based on their co-occurrence within transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "An item is said to have an association rule if it firstly meets the minimum support threshold, and it also is reliably found with another item in another set (Hu & Liu, n.d). For example, if an item, lets called it <strong>A</strong> is in set <strong>I</strong> and it is seen enough times with an item in set <strong>D</strong>, lets call this item <strong>B</strong>, then <strong>A</strong> is declared to have a sufficiently strong enough relationship with <strong>B</strong>. This means that the itemset `{A, B}` is declared to have a strong enough association rule and indicates a strong enough relationship between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, which means the itemset `{A, B}` is identified as a frequent feature in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to prepare the data for association mining we need to extract the noun and noun groups for processing, which we do by using the `extract_noun_and_noun_groups` method below. The `extract_noun_and_noun_groups` method returns the words that are marked with the pos tags `NN` or `NG` since these refer to nouns and noun groups respectively. After this the Apriori algorithm is deployed to find frequent itemsets from the nouns and noun groups (Hu & Liu, n.d). The Apriori algorithm usually performs two steps, however Hu & Liu (n.d) only performed only the first step in the algorithm. This is what has been deployed below as it was shown to be effective (Hu & Liu, n.d). This first step merely scans through the transaction set, which is the set of <strong>D</strong> (a subset of <strong>I</strong>), and finds any of the itemsets that occur frequently together (for example `{A, B}`), as long as they meet the minimum support threshold (Hu & Liu, n.d). After this, any itemsets which contain more than three items are pruned since they were found to be not useful (Hu & Liu, n.d)."

The purpose of this algorithm is to reduce the number of features with just a single word identified in the Frequent Features step (Hu & Liu, n.d).

Then, for each feature that is just a single word - check its p-support value and if it is below the threshold and is a subset of a feature with two or more words in it then it is pruned.\r\n",

    "Itemset number 62 is `(player, dvd)`. When inputting this into the sentiment analysis, it will need to be made into a word that is how English is written or spoken because this is what is more likely to appear in reviews. The phrase `player dvd` is not English but `DVD player` obviously is. A further preprocessing step is therefore required to make sure that the phrasing is correct. This will be done below in the `Preparing Dataframe for Input to Sentiment Analysis` section, because we still need to extract Infrequent Features and merge these with Frequent Features to create the Features Dictionary, first, before we prepare the Feature Dictionary for sentiment analysis."

    "### Only use opinion words that are positive or negative\n",
    "This is a slight diversion from Hu & Liu (2004), but I found that if too many neutral adjectives were in this stage then the number of Infrequent Features increased significantly and many of them were not features at all. For this reason, the neutral words were removed. This may cause some overfitting, which essentially means that new data that is given to a machine learning model gives inaccurate predictions because the training data was too closely tailored to specific examples it was trained on (Amazon, n.d). However in this context, there is a greater benefit to be had from reducing noise and this outweighs the potential drawback of overfitting. If there was scope to test out the different approaches, it would be beneficial to see whether including the neutral adjectives enhanced or reduced the performance of the classification models."

It checks if a noun, not already in the list of frequent features, is near sentiment bearing adjectives within a specified proximity (p_value) (Hu & Liu, 2004). If such adjectives are found, the the noun is flagged as an infrequent feature. The process iterates over all reviews, collecting these features for each product and duplicates are removed to ensure unique entries. This stage of the pipeline helps uncover less common but potentially important features associated with customer sentiment (Hu & Liu, 2004)."

    "A p_value of 2 was selected because it effectively balances capturing important contextual information without introducing too much noise. With a p_value of 1, the model might overlook relevant adjectives that are slightly further from the noun, while a p_value of 3 seems to introduce more unrelated words such as 'pro' and 'use', leading to less precise results. Therefore, arguably a p_value 2 provides enough context to identify meaningful infrequent features while minimising the risk of incorporating irrelevant data."

    "In this section, we need to create a copy of the original dataframe and use the features we have extracted to label each of the review sentences with potential feature we have found in the preceding steps in the pipeline. As mentioned previously, there is a problem with some of the features that have more than one word in them. For example the `MicroMP3` has a feature called `player, mp3`. Obviously this should be `mp3 player`. There are multiple instances of this problem that we need to fix in order to help us classify these review sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach I could have taken was to use an LLM to infer the meaning of the phrase (TechLatest.net, 2023). However, installing one that is accurate onto a Jupyter notebook is computationally expensive, and would require a higher amount of GPU's to run, which is why these kinds of tasks are often done in the Cloud (TechLatest.net, 2023). Instead, if a feature has more than one word in it, I have opted to simply check whether those words appear next to one another in the review or title sentence, and if they do, then I would use the ordering of the word or title sentence as the feature to look for. This way it is using natural language to determine if it is a feature or not. There is a possibility that there are some mistakes. But there are multiple instances of the features appearing in the incorrect order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to split the data so that it does not include anything that is in the test data (see below for test data). This is because in order to train the model that generalises accurately to new data, we need to make sure that the data that was used to train the model or improve it is not included in any unseen data (which is the testing data) (encord.com, n.d.)."

    "This report is going to use Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to try to determine the either positive or negative sentiment of specific features (Chusiano, 2022). Typical sentiment analysis involves analysing an entire sentence and determining whether the sentence is either positive or negative (Chusiano, 2022). This is useful most the time but there are also many times where sentences can have opposite polarities for different features so classifying all the features in a sentence with one polarity would be inaccurate (Chusiano, 2022). This is where ABSA is useful since it can determine the polarity of individual features within sentences (Chusiano, 2022). The previous feature extraction steps are crucial for ABSA because they identify the specific aspects or features within the text, allowing the model to determine the sentiment associated with each feature individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a comparitive assessment between two different sentiment analysis classification models in this section. The first will be a rules based ABSA approach (Aris Pattakos, 2021) and the second will use a pre-trained model that will use a supervised learning approach. The justification for why these are very different approaches and why a supervised learning approach will be used on top of the rules based approach will become apparent as you read through the report."

This can lead to there being more classifications towards the positive class than the negative class (Pilot, 2023)."

    "### Rules Based Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "The first sentiment analysis approach uses a very simple rules based approach algorithm. A rules based approach often uses PoS tags to determine adjectives that are close to aspects (or features) in text (Aris Pattakos, 2021). This particular algorithm is based on the most basic algorithm used used in Aris Pattakos (2021) and works in the following way:\n",
    "1. pass in a row from a dataframe which has preprocessed PoS tags in it and the potential aspects in there\n",
    "2. if the current word is an adjective, then check the next word and determine if it is the first word of the aspect (there can be more than one word in an aspect)\n",
    "3. if it is, then determine the sentiment of the adjective and add this to a column called `encoded_aspect`\n",
    "4. if it is not then add None to the `encoded_aspect` column. This denotes that there was no descriptor found for the aspect"

    "An obvious problem with the model in this current form in that it does not take into consideration things such as negation words (Hu & Liu, 2004). There is an opportunity here to introduce looking at the negation of words and whether they adjust the meaning of an adjective that is closest to a feature (Hu & Liu, 2004). For example, if the word 'not' appears before 'good' and that phrase (not good) is describing a feature, then that means the review sentence should be classified as being negative towards that feature (Hu & Liu, 2004). This is actually a problem with aspect based algorithms in general - they fail to spot the nuances and complexities of language and often are far less accurate than other methods (Sayedi, 2021). This is where a supervised learning approach will be better suited since these models are trained on a large corpus of data and can understand nuances better (IBM, 2023)."

    "Now I will compare the performance of the previous classification method with a supervised learning approach. A supervised learning approach uses a pretrained model to determine the sentiment of given feature (IBM, 2023). There are many pretrained models that can be used to perform sentiment analysis from `hugging face` (Chusiano, 2022). The model used here is `yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1` which can be found here at huggingface.co (n.d).\n",

    "A supervised learning approach is trained to perform specific tasks based on the training data it is provided (IBM, 2023). In the case of the model used in this report (`yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1`), this model was trained on over 180k examples of labelled data that gave polarity to particular aspects from sentiments (huggingface.co, n.d). \n",

    "A supervised learning approach uses labeled data to train a model and thereby make predictions (IBM, 2023). The `yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1` model has been pre trained on a large corpus of ABSA datasets (huggingface.co, n.d). The algorithm below is simple, in that for each review sentence, the features from the feature_dict are found within the review sentences and provided to the `yangheng/deberta-v3-base-absa-v1.1` model along with the review sentence. For each of the aspects provided from the feature_dict, the model outputs the predicted sentiment for that particular aspect. This approach is significantly different to the previous rule based method because it uses deep learning and huge corpus of data to infer complex relationships in the data, which should lead to more accurate sentiment analysis (IBM, 2023)."

    "comparing the product `Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player` (which is the first product), it is possible to cursorily glance and see that the `df_base_classifier_train` also seemingly has a very low accuracy score since it misses many of the classifications that the `df_supervised_learning_classifier_train` model got correct such as \"`apex ad2600 known capadabilty problem .`\" being classified as a negative review for `ad2600`.

    "It is possible to draw some meaningful conclusions. We can tell from the testing data that the supervised learning method is far superior at classifying reviews from this project. We can also observe from the product summaries that the supervised learning method is, again, far superior at classifying reviews from this project - but this time with unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, certainly more opportunities for future research. The groundtruth labels provided by Hu & Liu (n.d) were too different to the features discovered during the feature extraction phase. This discrepancy made it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the model on unseen data comprehensively. This would require removing the current groundtruth labels and adding ones that are more aligned with the features found in the preprocessing steps. This would also mean that we could use the training datasets to train the supervised learning method model, and then use the testing data to see how it performs on unseen data more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire system, there were many times where it could have been possible to fine tune certain parameters and test whether these increase or decrease the overall accuracy of the model. There were also opportunities to introduce tables, such as a confusion matrix, and graphs to better explain some of the results. However, the metrics above should suffice in demonstrating that the supervised learning approach is far superior to the very basic rules based ABSA model. There of course is also scope to introduce even more supervised learning methods, such as support vector machines, random forest or other deep learning neural networks that could prove to perform better than the current supervised learning method."
